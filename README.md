# The compiler provenance problem

Given the statement ”A malware is a malicious software that fulfills the deliberately harmful intent of an attacker” the idea behind the homework is to apply the machine learning techniques to a very first step of the malware analysis, the compiler provenance problem. Indeed, the aim of the malware analysis is to develop a deeper understanding about several aspects of malwares through the study of malicious samples. This can be done with the reverse engineering, the process by which the malware code is disassembled to reveal its binary code.
The relentless growth in complexity and volume of malware is getting more and more challenging deal with all these informations, here comes the reason behind the introduction of machine learning, which provides a natural choice to support the process of knowledge extraction. This technology in fact permits to build helpful tools to support the analysis process while working on huge amount of already known samples.
